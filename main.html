                <b>1. Be Safe: Know your plants. Only eat wild plants you're 100% sure of. 
                    <br>
                    Identify them correctly and know which parts are edible and how to prepare them.
                    <br>
                    Stay aware: Bring water, snacks, a first aid kit, and stay alert to your surroundings.
                    <br>
                    Avoid toxins: Don’t harvest from areas near roads, agriculture, or places sprayed with chemicals.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    2. Be Respectful: Get permission. Always ask before foraging on private land. A small gift can go a long way.
                    <br>
                    Follow the rules: Don’t forage in National Parks or areas where it’s prohibited.
                    <br>
                    Leave no trace: Pick up trash, fill holes, and leave the land as you found it.
                    <br>
                    Use what you take: Wasting foraged plants is disrespectful.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    3. Be Sustainable: Harvest lightly. Take no more than ¼ of what you find. Leave enough for wildlife and future growth.
                    <br>
                    Avoid over-harvested plants: Learn which species are threatened (e.g., ramps, white sage).
                    <br>
                    Take invasives freely: These are fine to collect in larger amounts.
                    <br>
                    Leave the biggest: Don’t take the only plant or the largest one (“mother plant”).</b>

                    <b>Learn by Doing: Take a class or walk with an experienced forager. Use all your senses to learn.
                        <br>
                        Start with one plant: Research it deeply—look-alikes, uses, preparation, and safety.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Use Good Resources: Look for regional plant guides and field books. Try mushroom-specific guides if interested in fungi.
                        <br>
                        Explore Herbalism: Great for going beyond identification into deeper plant uses.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Build Relationships with Plants: Be curious. Let yourself be drawn to a plant and study it deeply.
                        <br>
                        Taste and test: Try infusions, teas, or cooking with it (start slow to watch for allergies).
                        <br>
                        Experiment creatively: Use familiar food knowledge as a springboard.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Treat plants like friends: Get to know them season after season—there's always more to learn.
                        <br>
                        Let wonder and curiosity guide you: Foraging isn’t just about gathering food—it’s about building a lifelong connection with nature. </b>
